# Groups and Samples Module

The “Groups and Samples” module is a new feature in the version 2.0 of Quickomics. We enhanced sample selection in the new Groups and Samples tab. It provides a wide range of flexibility to select groups and samples by clicking and dragging them in a interactive manner. Users can select samples based on metadata, comparison, subsetting, or manual list.  The selected samples are used globally for all plots.

## Select groups and samples

Here, you can define your sample groups and modifying the samples to be included or excluded. It is also flexible to re-order the samples.
