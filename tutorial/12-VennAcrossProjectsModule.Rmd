# Venn Across Projects Module

This functionality in Quickomics is the only one that lets users probe more than one project/dataset together. The DEGs/DEPs identified in different comparisons across projects/datasets loaded in the interface can be compared here. By taking advantage of the “Protein Gene name” function, this module can be used to identify common DEGs/DEPs present in both RNAseq and Proteomics datasets of the same project.

## Venn Diagram

To illustrate this feature, we compare the two RNAseq and two Proteomic comparisons from Connor-Robson et al., 2019. We load 2 comparisons from each dataset/project and view the number of DEGs/DEPs that are common and different between the 4 comparisons.

Users have the option to view this Venn Diagram as a Black & White plot.

## Intersection Output

Like in 10.3 Intersection Output, Users can view the individual genes present in different regions of the Venn Diagram, like the ones identified in all the samples, or the ones only present in 3 of them.
